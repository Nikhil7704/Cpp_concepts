# C++ Concepts Repository

Welcome to my **C++ Concepts** repository! This repository is a collection of various C++ programming concepts that I have learned and implemented. It serves as a personal project to demonstrate my understanding of C++ and to share useful code snippets for beginners and advanced learners alike.

### Created by:
**Nikhil Tiwari**


## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of examples that explore and implement core C++ concepts. The aim is to build a knowledge base that can help anyone—from beginner programmers to advanced developers—learn key aspects of the C++ language.

### What you'll find here:
- Basic Syntax and Data Types
- Control Flow (loops, conditions)
- Functions and Recursion
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)
- Memory Management (Pointers, Dynamic Memory)
- Exception Handling
- C++ Standard Library (STL)

## Concepts Covered

This repository is organized into sections based on different C++ concepts:

### Basic Syntax & Data Types
- Learn about variables, constants, and different data types in C++.
  
### Control Flow
- Includes `if-else`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and `switch` statements.
  
### Functions
- Function definitions, calling functions, overloading functions, and recursion.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### Data Structures
- Implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees.

### Algorithms
- Learn sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and searching algorithms like Binary Search.

### Memory Management
- Working with pointers, dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`.

### Exception Handling
- Using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` to handle exceptions in C++.

### C++ Standard Library (STL)
- Explore common STL containers like `vector`, `list`, `map`, `set`, and iterators.
